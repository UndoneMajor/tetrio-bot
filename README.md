# Tetr.io Bot
# Tetr.io Bot with Hold Functionality

An intelligent Tetr.io bot that plays automatically with advanced hold mechanics, coordinate management, and strategic decision-making.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Hold System**: Automatically decides when to use hold based on piece evaluation
- **Coordinate Management**: Save/load coordinates for easy setup
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause the bot anytime during gameplay
- **Strategic AI**: Evaluates multiple move options and chooses the best one
- **Real-time Board Scanning**: Adapts to different game modes and situations
- **Easy Setup**: Simple coordinate configuration system

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (3.10 recommended because sigma)
  - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/
- Required packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - `keyboard`
  - `numpy`
  - `PIL` (Pillow its pillow!!!! pip install pillow NOT PIL)
  - `pyautogui`
  - `math` (built-in so not needed lmaoaoaoao)

## üéÆ Controls

### Main Controls **note that you can change all of them easily in the code just find it yh lol lmao
- **SPACE**: Start the bot
- **ESC**: Exit the bot
- **Q**: Pause/Unpause during gameplay (buggy sometiemes require you to hold sometimes not woa technologia)
- **;**: Reconfigure coordinates (in case you misclick or smth)

### Coordinate Setup (Manual Mode)
- **[-]**: Set board top-left corner
- **[=]**: Set board bottom-right corner
- **[[ ]**: Set first piece position
- **[] ]**: Set fifth piece position
- **[\ ]**: Set hold box position
- **ENTER**: Finish coordinate setup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (for newbs :P)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Bot
```
python bet.py
```

### 3. Configure Coordinates
When you first run the bot, you'll see:
```
=== Coordinate Setup ===
1. Load coordinates from coordinates.json
2. Set coordinates manually
```

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Load existing coordinates
- Choose `1` if you have a `coordinates.json` file
- Bot will load coordinates automatically

**Option 2**: Manual setup
- Choose `2` for manual coordinate setup
- Follow the on-screen instructions to set each coordinate
- Coordinates are automatically saved after setup to coordinates.json

### 4. Start Playing
- Press **SPACE** to start the bot
- Press **Q** to pause/unpause anytime
- Press **ESC** to exit

## üß† How It Works

### Hold System !!!! (WOWZA)
The bot intelligently (:P foreshadowing...) evaluates three options for each piece:
1. **Place current piece directly**
2. **Use held piece** (if available)
3. **Hold current piece and use next piece**

The bot chooses the option with the highest score, considering:
- Board state evaluation
- Piece placement efficiency
- Future piece possibilities
- Hold strategy optimization
(no ai involved in case you hate ai)
### Coordinate System
- **Board coordinates**: Define the playing field area
- **Piece coordinates**: Track the piece queue positions
- **Hold coordinates**: Monitor the hold box
- **Auto-calculation**: Intermediate piece positions are calculated automatically

### AI Strategy
The bot uses a evaluation system that considers:
- **Height management**: Prefers lower piece placements
- **Hole prevention**: Avoids creating gaps
- **Line clearing**: Prioritizes full row clears
- **Hold optimization**: Strategic use of hold feature

## üìÅ File Structure

```
Tetrio-bot-main/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bet.py                 # Main bot script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TetrisBoard.py         # Board management class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coordinates.json       # Saved coordinates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

## ‚ö° Performance Settings

You can adjust these settings in `bet.py`:

```python
# AI Settings
calculation_accuracy = 5    # Higher = more accurate but slower (recommended: "5" because 6 7 :OOOOOO)
max_depth = 6              # Look ahead depth (max 6)
wait_time = 0.04           # its about screen refreshing so dont touch if it works why bother right lol

# Game Settings
key_delay = 0.02           # Delay between key presses
scan_board = True          # Enable board scanning
jstris = False             # Set to True for Jstris mode (who ever plays that mode bruh)
```

## üéØ Game Modes

### Tetr.io Mode (Default)
- Optimized for Tetr.io interface
- Default colors and keybinds
- Standard coordinate ranges

### Jstris Mode
- Set `jstris = True` in the code
- Different colors and keybinds
- Adjusted coordinate ranges

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues !!!!!!!

**Bot not detecting pieces correctly:**
- Recalibrate coordinates using manual setup
- Ensure Tetr.io is in fullscreen mode and minimal graphics! (Idk sometimes works with extra graphics but alr idk)
- Check that coordinates are set accurately (dont delete coordinates.json it cant recreate itself)

**Hold not working:**
- Verify hold coordinates are set correctly
- Make sure hold key ('C') is not conflicting with other keys
- Check that hold box is visible and not covered

**Bot moving too fast/slow:**
- Adjust `key_delay` in settings
- Decrease `key_delay` if bot is too slow but just dont lol its suspicious.

### Performance Tips

- **Higher accuracy**: Increase `calculation_accuracy` (slower but better)
- **Faster gameplay**: Decrease `wait_time` and `key_delay`
- **Better hold decisions**: The bot automatically optimizes hold usage

## üìä Coordinate File Format

The `coordinates.json` file contains: (NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST EXAMPLE AND YOU HAVE TO SET IT BY YOURSELF BECAUSE OF RESOLUTION DIFFERENCE!!!!!)
```json
{
    "x1_board": 777,
    "y1_board": 203,
    "x2_board": 1144,
    "y2_board": 937,
    "x1": 1264,
    "y1": 310,
    "x5": 1265,
    "y5": 744,
    "x_hold": 682,
    "y_hold": 309
}
```

## üéÆ Tips for Best Performance

1. **Use fullscreen mode** for consistent coordinate detection
2. **Set coordinates precisely** for accurate piece detection
3. **Adjust settings** based on your system performance (LOCK Chrome with 60fps or 120fps based on your screen refresh it doesnt make much sense and difference yet but still conscious.)
4. **Monitor the bot** during initial runs to ensure proper operation
5. **Use pause feature** (Q key) to stop/start as needed between round ending or resetting if bot is buggy
